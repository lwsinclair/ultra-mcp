#### Manual Installation

Add to your Claude Code settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ultra-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "ultra-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Integration with Cursor

First configure your API keys:

```bash
npx -y ultra-mcp config
```

Then add to your Cursor MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ultra-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "ultra-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

Ultra MCP will automatically use the API keys you configured with the `config` command.

## MCP Tools & Prompts

Ultra MCP provides powerful AI tools accessible through Claude Code and Cursor. **New in v0.7.0**: All tools are now also available as **discoverable prompts** in Claude Code.

### 🎯 Prompts Support (New in v0.7.0)

All Ultra MCP tools are now exposed as **discoverable prompts** in Claude Code, making them even easier to use:

- **25 discoverable prompts** corresponding to all existing tools
- **Parameter guidance** built into each prompt template
- **Natural language interface** for all AI capabilities
- **Automatic discovery** by Claude Code and other MCP clients

**How to use prompts:**

1. Type `/` in Claude Code to see available prompts
2. Select any Ultra MCP prompt (e.g., "Deep Reasoning", "Code Review", "Debug Issue")
3. Fill in the parameters through the guided interface
4. Claude automatically generates the appropriate instruction

This makes Ultra MCP's powerful AI capabilities more accessible than ever!

- **Use Cases**: Complex algorithms, architectural decisions, deep analysis

### 🔍 Investigate (`investigate`)

Thoroughly investigate topics with configurable depth levels.

- **Depth Levels**: shallow, medium, deep
- **Google Search**: Enabled by default for Gemini
- **Use Cases**: Research topics, explore concepts, gather insights

### 📚 Research (`research`)

Conduct comprehensive research with multiple output formats.

- **Output Formats**: summary, detailed, academic
- **Use Cases**: Literature reviews, technology comparisons, documentation

### 📋 List Models (`list-ai-models`)

View all available AI models and their configuration status.

### Example Usage

```javascript
// In Claude Code or Cursor with MCP
await use_mcp_tool('ultra-mcp', 'deep-reasoning', {
  provider: 'openai',
  prompt: 'Design a distributed caching system for microservices',
  reasoningEffort: 'high',
});
```

## Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/RealMikeChong/ultra-mcp
cd ultra-mcp

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Build TypeScript
bun run build

# Run tests
bun run test

# Development mode with watch
bun run dev

# Test with MCP Inspector
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node dist/cli.js
```

## Architecture

Ultra MCP acts as a bridge between multiple AI model providers and MCP clients:

1. **MCP Protocol Layer**: Implements Model Context Protocol for Claude Code/Cursor communication
2. **Model Providers**: Integrates OpenAI, Google (Gemini), Azure OpenAI, and xAI Grok via Vercel AI SDK
3. **Unified Interface**: Single MCP interface to access multiple AI models
4. **Configuration Management**: Secure local storage with schema validation

### Key Components

- `src/cli.ts` - CLI entry point with commander
- `src/server.ts` - MCP server implementation
- `src/config/` - Configuration management with schema validation
- `src/handlers/` - MCP protocol handlers
- `src/providers/` - Model provider implementations
- `src/utils/` - Shared utilities for streaming and error handling

## Configuration Storage

Ultra MCP stores configuration in your system's default config directory:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Preferences/ultra-mcp-nodejs/`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/ultra-mcp/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\ultra-mcp-nodejs\`

## Environment Variables

You can also set API keys and base URLs via environment variables:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_BASE_URL`
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` / `GOOGLE_BASE_URL`
- `AZURE_API_KEY` / `AZURE_BASE_URL` (base URL required for Azure)
- `XAI_API_KEY` / `XAI_BASE_URL`

_Note: Configuration file takes precedence over environment variables._

## Vector Embeddings Configuration

Ultra MCP supports vector embeddings for semantic code search. By default, it uses **text-embedding-3-small** for cost efficiency (6.5x cheaper than the large model).

### Embedding Model Configuration

You can customize the embedding models in your configuration:

```json
{
  "vectorConfig": {
    "embeddingModel": {
      "openai": "text-embedding-3-small",  // or "text-embedding-3-large"
      "azure": "text-embedding-3-small",    // or "text-embedding-3-large"
      "gemini": "text-embedding-004"
    }
  }
}
```

### Model Comparison

| Model | Cost | Dimensions | MTEB Score | Best For |
|-------|------|------------|------------|----------|
| text-embedding-3-small | $0.02/1M tokens | 1536 | 62.3% | Cost-effective code search |
| text-embedding-3-large | $0.13/1M tokens | 3072 | 64.6% | Maximum accuracy |

### Migration Notes

- **Existing Databases**: If you have an existing vector database created with `text-embedding-3-large`, it will continue to work but won't be compatible with new embeddings from `text-embedding-3-small`. Consider re-indexing if you want to use the smaller model.
- **Backward Compatibility**: You can always override the model by configuring `embeddingModel` in your vector config.

## About the Author

👋 **Mike Chong** - Building tools to amplify human potential through AI.

As one of the earliest **users** of GitHub Copilot (personally invited by Nat Friedman, former GitHub CEO), I've witnessed firsthand how AI-assisted development can transform the way we build software. My journey as a former engineer on **Outlook iOS/Android** taught me the importance of creating tools that genuinely improve people's daily lives.

**Ultra MCP** represents my vision of democratizing access to the best AI models, making cutting-edge AI capabilities accessible to every developer through a unified, simple interface. I believe that by removing barriers between developers and AI models, we can accelerate innovation and create a better world for everyone.

_"The future belongs to those who can seamlessly orchestrate human creativity with AI capabilities."_

## Why Ultra MCP is Different from Zen MCP Server

While both projects aim to enhance AI development workflows, Ultra MCP brings unique advantages:

1. **Written in TypeScript** - Full type safety, excellent IDE support, and a more maintainable codebase

2. **Vector Search Support** - Built-in semantic code search using vector embeddings
   - Index your entire codebase with `npx ultra-mcp index`
   - Search with natural language queries: `npx ultra-mcp search "authentication logic"`
   - Powered by OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and Google Gemini embeddings
   - Local SQLite storage with libSQL vector extension for efficient similarity search
   - Smart chunking and overlap for optimal search results

3. **Built-in Dashboard & Usage Tracking** - Comprehensive analytics and cost monitoring
   - Web dashboard with live metrics and real-time statistics
   - Automatic tracking of all LLM requests with token counts
   - **Continuously updated pricing via LiteLLM** - Accurate cost calculations
   - Tiered pricing support (e.g., Gemini's long-context pricing tiers)
   - SQLite database powered by libSQL for local-first privacy

4. **Advanced Pricing System** - Real-time cost management
   - Fetches latest pricing from LiteLLM's GitHub repository
   - File-based caching with 1-hour TTL to minimize network calls
   - CLI commands: `npx ultra-mcp pricing show gpt-4o`
   - Accurate cost tracking for hundreds of models across all providers
   - Automatic fallback to cached data when offline

Unlike many MCP implementations, Ultra MCP includes built-in vector search and a pricing-aware dashboard out of the box. These features make Ultra MCP particularly suited for developers who want robust tooling with built-in cost visibility and intelligent code search capabilities for responsible AI usage.
